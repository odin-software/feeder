Webapp where you can add RSS URIs, save them and then get a feed with all the articles.

You can get a feed with all the posts or articles where each feed is limited to 15 posts and they are all sorted.

You can also check every feed individually and get all the posts the rss has.

I wrote about this project in [my blog](https://kengru.do/posts/feeder-rss-reader).

## Install

Install dependencies with `yarn` or `npm`:

`yarn install`

## Run

Should be as easy as:

`yarn dev`
